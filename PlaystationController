PlayStation Controller
======================
Es basado en la configuracion basica de botones establecida con el Controller del Super NES.
Se adiciono un par de botones de Shoulder buttons para los dedos de la mitad.
Para compensar for the less stable grip from shifting the middle fingers' placement to the shoulders, 
grip handles were added to the controller.
The original version (model SCPH-1010) was released alongside the PlayStation on December 3, 1994

>>>Dual Analog Controller
is Sony's first handheld analog controller for the PlayStation, and the predecessor to the DualShock. 
Its first official analog controller was the PlayStation Analog Joystick (SCPH-1110).
The Dual Analog Controller was first displayed under glass at the PlayStation Expo 96-97 
which was held from November 1 to November 4, 1996. It was released in Japan in April 1997.
It was advertised as allowing for more precise and fluid control of the games' fighters, 
with the rumble feature contributing to a more realistic experience.
Before its release in the United States, Sony decided that vibration feedback would be removed 
from the European and American versions of the controller. According to a Sony spokesperson, 
"We evaluated all the features and decided, for manufacturing reasons, that what was most important 
to gamers was the analog feature."

It was released in the United States on August 27, 1997; and in Europe in September 1997 with little promotion. 
A few months later, the first DualShock controller was released in Japan on November 20, 1997.

Fans of a smaller form factor, Japanese players complained that the very long hand grips made the controller 
too large to be held properly and the lack of a rumble feature in the U.S. and European models are the most 
commonly cited reasons that Sony decided to end production of this controller and redesign it. 
This redesign eventually became the DualShock.

>>>DualShock
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DualShock#Original_DualShock
The DualShock (originally Dual Shock; trademarked as DUALSHOCK or DUAL SHOCK) is a line of gamepads 
with vibration-feedback developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment for PlayStation consoles and devices

The DualShock Analog Controller (SCPH-1200), a controller capable of providing vibration feedback, 
was based on the onscreen actions taking place in the game (if the game supports it), 
as well as analog input through two analog sticks. Its name derives from its use of two (dual) 
vibration motors (shock). These motors are housed within the handles of the controller, with the left 
one being larger and more powerful than the one on the right, so as to allow for varying levels of vibration.

The DualShock also features two additional buttons when compared to the Dual Analog, L3 and R3, 
which are triggered by depressing the analog sticks.

>>>DualShock 2
When the PlayStation 2 computer entertainment system was announced, the DualShock 2 Analog Controller (SCPH-10010) 
included with it was almost exactly the same externally as the previous DualShock analog controller. 
There were however a few minor cosmetic changes. It has different screw positioning and one fewer screw.

Internally, the DualShock 2 was lighter and all of the buttons (except for the Analog mode, start, select, L3 and R3 buttons) 
were readable as analog values (pressure-sensitive).

>>>DualShock 3
Announced at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show, the DualShock 3 wireless controller (SCPH-98050/CECHZC2) is a gamepad for the PlayStation 3. 
It replaces the Sixaxis wireless controller originally released with earlier versions of the console. 
The DualShock 3 is nearly identical to the previous Sixaxis version but adds the haptic feedback – 
also known as force feedback – capabilities found in the DualShock and DualShock 2.

The settlement cleared the way for incorporating the missing "rumble" feature that the Sixaxis lacked. Both the vibration function 
and motion-sensing capabilities of the DualShock 3 can be used simultaneously without one interfering with the other. 

Like the Sixaxis, it also has a USB mini-B port for charging and can also be used on a PSP Go via Bluetooth, 
though the controller and the PSP Go must be registered using a PS3 console.

When connected via USB, the controller communicates with the console through the USB cable, rather than Bluetooth.

[[[IMPORTANTE]]]
While the DualShock 3 is compatible with any standard USB mini-B cable and many USB chargers, official charging cables are available from Sony. 
These include an official cable, the USB 2.0 Cable Pack and a wall charger, the AC adapter charging kit. Any third-party USB charger used must 
act as a USB host device, rather than simply providing power over the appropriate pins, since both the Sixaxis and DualShock 3 require 
a host signal to "wake up" and begin charging.

>>>DualShock 4
The DualShock 4 (CUH-ZCT1) is the PlayStation 4's controller. It is similar to the DualShock 3, with several new features. 
One new feature is a built-in two-point capacitive touch pad on the front of the controller, which can be clicked. 
The controller supports motion detection via a three-axis gyroscope and three-axis accelerometer and vibration.[25] 
It includes a non-removable,[26] rechargeable 3.7 V, 1000 mAh lithium-ion battery, which can be charged while the system is in rest mode. 
It weighs 210 g (7.4 oz) and has dimensions of 162 mm × 52 mm × 98 mm (6.4 in × 2.0 in × 3.9 in).[26] 
It also lacks a Sony logo on the front due to the Touchpad in its place.

The top of the gamepad features a light bar with three LEDs that illuminate in different colors, which can be used to identify players 
by matching the colors of the characters they are controlling in a game, or to provide enhanced feedback or immersion by changing patterns 
or colors in reaction to gameplay. 

The controller features several input and output connectors: a stereo headset jack (3.5 mm CTIA TRRS connector), a micro-USB port 
and an extension port.[25] It can be charged via microUSB, a dedicated charging station, or the console (even when the console is off).[25] 
It also includes a mono speaker, like the Wii Remote, and is the second major controller in video game history to have such feature.[25]

The DualShock 4 features the following buttons: PS button, SHARE button, OPTIONS button, directional buttons, action buttons 
(triangle, circle, cross, square), shoulder buttons (R1/L1), triggers (R2/L2), analog stick click buttons (L3/R3) and a touch pad click button.[25] 
These mark several changes from the DualShock 3 and other previous PlayStation controllers. The START and SELECT buttons have been merged 
into a single OPTIONS button.[25][26] A dedicated SHARE button will allow players to upload videos from their gameplay experiences.[25] 
The joysticks and triggers have been redesigned based on developer input,[25] with the ridged surface of the joysticks now featuring an 
outer ring surrounding the convex dome caps.

Despite innovations, the controller has a few regressions from the DualShock 3. Pressure sensitivity has been removed from all buttons 
except L2 and R2. This is likely due to the fact that most games did not utilize these buttons as well as due to it not being used on 
competitors controllers (including Wii U and Xbox One).

[[[UPDATE DualShock 4]]]
In early September 2016, Sony confirmed a second generation of DualShock 4 controllers, known as the DualShock V2 (CUH-ZCT2), 
which hosts slight improvements over the original DualShock 4, including USB communication, a longer battery life and the ability 
to see the light bar from the top of the touchpad. It released on September 15, 2016.

In the initial controller version, the light bar was a permanently illuminated, bright-colored light. The potential for light pollution 
in darkened playing rooms as well as an interest in extending battery life led to inquiries as to whether the light bar could be switched off 
by users when not required in game; Sony executive Shuhei Yoshida initially responded in the negative (July 2013),[33][34] though 
videogame developers had the option to disable the light in game.[35] In early 2014, the company announced that a future update would allow 
the light bar to be dimmed.[36] (Enabled by system update 1.70 of April 2014.[37])
