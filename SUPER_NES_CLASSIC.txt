Hardware

Allwinner R16 SoC

Software
========
FEL boot
-armbian
-linux-sunxi

FEL is a low-level subroutine contained in the BootROM on "Allwinner" devices.
It is used for initial programming and recovery of devices using USB.

Your device therefore needs to be attached to a host (your PC) by means of a USB cable,
connected to a port where the "sunxi" device will present itself as a USB 'slave' (i.e. in device mode).
Usually that means the "OTG" connector.

Entering FEL mode
=================
While there are a few different ways to trigger FEL mode, they are not always equal.
Some do low-level initialization (load Boot0 and Boot1), and some don't

If you are going to use FEL mode to retrieve device information, you need a to pick a method of entering FEL mode 
that initializes Boot1.

Power off your device
=====================
Before you try to enter FEL mode, make sure that your device is "truly powered off". Do not leave any cables attached.
Due to a common design flaw, (current leaking from) the "UART" will often keep the device in a slightly working state.
So before you power up your device again: diconnect your UART, and re-attach it. 

FEL Protocol
============
The FEL is actually a tiny usb stack implementing a special USB protocol.
Part of it is impl
