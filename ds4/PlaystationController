PlayStation Controller
======================
Es basado en la configuracion basica de botones establecida con el Controller del Super NES.
Se adiciono un par de botones de Shoulder buttons para los dedos de la mitad.
Para compensar for the less stable grip from shifting the middle fingers' placement to the shoulders, 
grip handles were added to the controller.
The original version (model SCPH-1010) was released alongside the PlayStation on December 3, 1994

>>>Dual Analog Controller
is Sony's first handheld analog controller for the PlayStation, and the predecessor to the DualShock. 
Its first official analog controller was the PlayStation Analog Joystick (SCPH-1110).
The Dual Analog Controller was first displayed under glass at the PlayStation Expo 96-97 
which was held from November 1 to November 4, 1996. It was released in Japan in April 1997.
It was advertised as allowing for more precise and fluid control of the games' fighters, 
with the rumble feature contributing to a more realistic experience.
Before its release in the United States, Sony decided that vibration feedback would be removed 
from the European and American versions of the controller. According to a Sony spokesperson, 
"We evaluated all the features and decided, for manufacturing reasons, that what was most important 
to gamers was the analog feature."

It was released in the United States on August 27, 1997; and in Europe in September 1997 with little promotion. 
A few months later, the first DualShock controller was released in Japan on November 20, 1997.

Fans of a smaller form factor, Japanese players complained that the very long hand grips made the controller 
too large to be held properly and the lack of a rumble feature in the U.S. and European models are the most 
commonly cited reasons that Sony decided to end production of this controller and redesign it. 
This redesign eventually became the DualShock.

>>>DualShock
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DualShock#Original_DualShock
The DualShock (originally Dual Shock; trademarked as DUALSHOCK or DUAL SHOCK) is a line of gamepads 
with vibration-feedback developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment for PlayStation consoles and devices

The DualShock Analog Controller (SCPH-1200), a controller capable of providing vibration feedback, 
was based on the onscreen actions taking place in the game (if the game supports it), 
as well as analog input through two analog sticks. Its name derives from its use of two (dual) 
vibration motors (shock). These motors are housed within the handles of the controller, with the left 
one being larger and more powerful than the one on the right, so as to allow for varying levels of vibration.

The DualShock also features two additional buttons when compared to the Dual Analog, L3 and R3, 
which are triggered by depressing the analog sticks.

>>>DualShock 2
When the PlayStation 2 computer entertainment system was announced, the DualShock 2 Analog Controller (SCPH-10010) 
included with it was almost exactly the same externally as the previous DualShock analog controller. 
There were however a few minor cosmetic changes. It has different screw positioning and one fewer screw.

Internally, the DualShock 2 was lighter and all of the buttons (except for the Analog mode, start, select, L3 and R3 buttons) 
were readable as analog values (pressure-sensitive).

>>>Sixaxis
Sixaxis (trademarked SIXAXIS) is a wireless gamepad produced by Sony for their PlayStation 3 video game console. 
It was introduced alongside the PlayStation 3 in 2006 and remained the console's official controller until 2008. 
The term "sixaxis" is also used to refer to the motion-sensing technology in PlayStation 3 controllers. 
It is a contraction of "six axis", which refers to the ability to sense motion in all axes of the six degrees of freedom.

A major feature of the Sixaxis controller, and from where its name is derived, is the ability to sense both rotational orientation 
and translational acceleration along all three-dimensional axes, providing six degrees of freedom.

The Sixaxis features finer analog sensitivity than the DualShock 2, increased to 10-bit precision from the 8-bit precision of the DualShock 2.
The controller also uses both analog and digital signals simultaneously at all times during gameplay. The frame beneath the L2 and R2 buttons 
has been omitted and these buttons have been made trigger-like, with the range of travel determining the degree of analog input rather 
than the range of pressure.

In the place of the "Analog" mode button of previous Sony dual analog controllers (Dual Analog, DualShock and DualShock 2) is a jewel-like "PS button" 
with the PlayStation logo, which can be used to access the home menu or XMB (after system software version 2.40), switch controller inputs and turn the 
console or the controller on or off. It fulfills a similar function to the "Guide" button featured on Microsoft's Xbox 360 controller, 
or the "Home" button on the Wii Remote.

Sony announced that because of the included motion sensors, the vibration feature of previous PlayStation controllers was removed, 
stating that the vibration would interfere with motion-sensing

[Wireless technology]
In a change from previous PlayStation controllers, the Sixaxis features wireless connectivity based on the Bluetooth standard. 
However, the Sixaxis lacks a Bluetooth "discovery mode", which is normally used for connecting to Bluetooth devices wirelessly, so a wired USB connection 
is required to set up the Sixaxis with the appropriate Bluetooth address before a wireless connection can be made. When used with the PSP Go, 
a PS3 is required to set up the Sixaxis.

[Power]
The Sixaxis wireless controller features an internal 3.7 V Li-ion battery, which provides up to 30 hours of continuous gaming on a full charge. 
Third party replacement batteries are also available. The battery was originally not thought to be replaceable when a Sony spokesperson stated 
that the Sixaxis should operate for "many years before there's any degradation in terms of battery performance. When and if this happens, 
then of course Sony will be providing a service to exchange these items".[19] Later, it was revealed that the Sixaxis came with 
instructions on how to remove the battery and that the battery was fully removable.[20] The DualShock 3 also uses this battery.

The Sixaxis can also draw power over a USB cable via a USB mini-B connector on the top of the controller. This allows the controller to be used when 
the battery is low and is also used for charging the battery. When connected via USB, the controller will communicate with the console over 
the USB connection, rather than wirelessly. This also applies to the DualShock 3.

[LEDs]
On the top of the controller is a row of four numbered LEDs, which are used to identify and distinguish multiple wireless controllers. 
These are similar to the indicators found on the Wii remote and the ring of light Xbox 360 Controller. Since the PlayStation 3 supports 
up to 7 controllers, but the controller only features 4 LEDs, controllers 5, 6 and 7 are represented as the sum of two other indicators 
(for example controller 5 is represented by illuminating indicators '4' and '1' at the same time, since 4+1=5). Sony also patented a technology to be able 
to track the motion of these LEDs with the PlayStation Eye camera for use alongside the PlayStation Move Controller. Though this was never utilised 
with the DualShock 3, its successor, the DualShock 4, features a light bar used for motion tracking, as well as player identification.

>>>DualShock 3
Anunciado en el Tokyo Game Show del 2007, the DualShock 3 wireless controller (SCPH-98050/CECHZC2) is a gamepad for the PlayStation 3. 
It replaces the Sixaxis wireless controller originally released with earlier versions of the console. 
The DualShock 3 is nearly identical to the previous Sixaxis version but adds the haptic feedback 
also known as force feedback capabilities found in the DualShock and DualShock 2.

The settlement cleared the way for incorporating the missing "rumble" feature that the Sixaxis lacked. 
Both the vibration function and motion-sensing capabilities of the DualShock 3 can be used simultaneously 
without one interfering with the other. 

Like the Sixaxis, it also has a USB mini-B port for charging and can also be used on a PSP Go via Bluetooth, 
though the controller and the PSP Go must be registered using a PS3 console.

When connected via USB, the controller communicates with the console through the USB cable, rather than Bluetooth.

[[[IMPORTANTE]]]
While the DualShock 3 is compatible with any standard USB mini-B cable and many USB chargers, official charging cables are available from Sony. 
These include an official cable, the USB 2.0 Cable Pack and a wall charger, the AC adapter charging kit. Any third-party USB charger used must 
act as a USB host device, rather than simply providing power over the appropriate pins, since both the Sixaxis and DualShock 3 require 
a host signal to "wake up" and begin charging.

>>>DualShock 4
The DualShock 4 (CUH-ZCT1) es el control-pad de la PlayStation 4. Este es similar al DualShock 3, con varias mejoras.
Una de sus nuevas caracteristicas es el touch pad de dos-puntos incluido, ubicado en el frente del control, el que tambien puede ser clickeado.  
El control soporta deteccion de movimiento por medio de un giroscopio de tres ejes y un acelerometro de tres ejes y vibracion.
Este incluye una bateria no removible, recargable de 3.7 V, 1000 mAh lithium-ion, el cual puede ser cargado mientras el sistema se encuentra
en rest mode. Este pesa 210 g (7.4 oz) y tiene las dimenciones de 162 mm × 52 mm × 98 mm (6.4 in × 2.0 in × 3.9 in).
Fue removido el logo de Sony que estaba en frente debido al Touchpad.

En frente del control trae una nueva caracteristica, el light bar con tres LEDs que iluminan en colores diferentes, este es utilizado para
identificar los jugadores, al hacer match los colores de los characteres que se encuentran controlando en el juego, o para ofrecer 
retroalimentacion mejorada o imersion al cambiar el patrones o colores en reaccion al gameplay
 
The controller features several input and output connectors: a stereo headset jack (3.5 mm CTIA TRRS connector), a micro-USB port 
and an extension port. It can be charged via microUSB, a dedicated charging station, or the console (even when the console is off). 
Este tambien incluye un mono speaker, como el del Wii Remote (siendo el segundo control en la historia de los video juegos en tener dicha caracteristica)

The DualShock 4 features the following buttons: PS button, SHARE button, OPTIONS button, directional buttons, action buttons 
(triangle, circle, cross, square), shoulder buttons (R1/L1), triggers (R2/L2), analog stick click buttons (L3/R3) and a touch pad click button. 

Estos marcan severos cambios desde el DualShock 3 y demas controles de PlayStation. Los botones START y SELECT han sido mergidos en uno solo
el botono OPTIONS. El boton SHARE dedicado, permitira a los jugadores a subir videos desde sus gameplay experiences. 
The joysticks and triggers have been redesigned based on developer input,[25] with the ridged surface of the joysticks now featuring an 
outer ring surrounding the convex dome caps.

Despite innovations, the controller has a few regressions from the DualShock 3. Pressure sensitivity has been removed from all buttons 
except L2 and R2. This is likely due to the fact that most games did not utilize these buttons as well as due to it not being used on 
competitors controllers (including Wii U and Xbox One).

[[[UPDATE DualShock 4]]]
A principios de Septiembre de 2016, Sony confirmo una segunda generacion de controles DualShock 4, conocido como the DualShock V2 (CUH-ZCT2),
el cual viene con unas sutiles mejoras sobre el DualShock 4 original, incluyendo comunicacion via USB, una mas larga vida de bateria y la posibilidad
de ver el color de la luz de la barra en la parte superior del touchpad. Este fue lanzado en September 15, 2016.

In the initial controller version, the light bar was a permanently illuminated, bright-colored light. The potential for light pollution 
in darkened playing rooms as well as an interest in extending battery life led to inquiries as to whether the light bar could be switched off 
by users when not required in game; Sony executive Shuhei Yoshida initially responded in the negative (July 2013),[33][34] though 
videogame developers had the option to disable the light in game.[35] In early 2014, the company announced that a future update would allow 
the light bar to be dimmed.[36] (Enabled by system update 1.70 of April 2014.[37])
