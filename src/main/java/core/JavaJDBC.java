Introducing Relational Databases
and SQL
Data is information. A piece of data is one fact, such as your first name. A database is an
organized collection of data. In the real world, a file cabinet is a type of database. It has file
folders, each of which contains pieces of paper. The file folders are organized in some way,
often alphabetically. Each piece of paper is like a piece of data. Similarly, the folders on your
computer are like a database. The folders provide organization, and each file is a piece of data.
A relational database is a database that is organized into tables, which consist of rows
and columns. You can think of a table as a spreadsheet. There are two main ways to access
a relational database from Java:
■■ Java Database Connectivity Language (JDBC): Accesses data as rows and columns.
JDBC is the API covered in this chapter.
■■ Java Persistence API (JPA): Accesses data through Java objects using a concept called
object-relational mapping (ORM). The idea is that you don’t have to write as much
code, and you get your data in Java objects. JPA is not on the exam, and therefore it is
not covered in this chapter.
■■ A relational database is accessed through Structured Query Language (SQL).
■■ In addition to relational databases, there is another type of database called a NoSQL
database. This is for databases that store their data in a format other than tables.
NoSQL is out of scope for the exam as well.
■■ In the following sections, we introduce a small relational database that we will be
using for the examples in this chapter and present the SQL to access it. We will also
cover some vocabulary that you need to know.
		
In all of the other chapters of this book, you need to write code and try lots of examples.
This chapter is different. It’s still nice to try out the examples, but you can probably get
the JDBC questions correct on the exam from just reading this chapter and mastering the
review questions.
Luckily, Java comes with an embedded database called JavaDB. JavaDB is a
version of the open source Derby database that comes automatically with the JDK
(http://db.apache.org/derby). To practice for the exam, Derby is sufficient.
